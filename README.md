# Hey, I’m Alan

Full-stack developer based in Jakarta. I write code that works—mostly clean, sometimes ugly, always honest.

- Mainly JavaScript, TypeScript, and .NET
- Building web apps, backend APIs, and messing with hardware when I can
- Learning and figuring things out as I go

If you want to talk code, projects, or just shoot the shit, hit me up.
